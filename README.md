Today is still an ordinary day. The project manager still didn't let me do anything. However, my JDBC phase is almost over, but today's JDBC is really difficult. I don't know what I'm talking about when I do generics. I can understand it clearly, but I can't knock it out by myself. However, I will soon enter the Java Web stage. I feel that I can finally do some projects and understand the business code in the future. But now I am most worried about English, because it is really difficult, and a stone in my heart still hasn't landed. To be honest, this feeling is very uncomfortable, I don't know how long this uncomfortable state will last. I think it may be about two years. When I find a job, I will really show my anxiety. It's very bitter, really bitter. The major of computer is really not readable by ordinary people.
